## What is ikigai? 
What’s your reason for getting up in the morning? 

In Japan, people who have ikigai (pronounced ick-ee-guy) have a reason to jump out of bed every morning. The Japanese island of Okinawa, where ikigai has its origins, is said to be home to the largest population of centenarians in the world. 

Hector Garcia, the co-author of Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life writes:

> "Your ikigai is at the intersection of what you are good at and what you love doing.”

## Why is it important? 

Hector says, 
> “Your ikigai is at the intersection of what you are good at and what you love doing,”

Studies show that losing one’s purpose can have a detrimental effect on your life.

>“Just as humans have lusted after objects and money since the dawn of time, other humans have felt dissatisfaction at the relentless pursuit of money and fame and have instead focused on something bigger than their own material wealth. This has over the years been described using many different words and practices, but always hearkening back to the central core of meaningfulness in life.”

## How can I find my ikigai? 

Follow your curiosity. Don’t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and do it. What the world needs is people who have come alive. When you find it, pursue it with all you have because anything less is not worth your limited time on planet earth.

To find your ikigai, ask yourself these four questions:
  1. What do I love?
  2. What am I good at?
  3. What can I be paid for now — or something that could transform into my future hustle?
  4. What does the world need?

## How will I know if I've discovered it? 

ikigai is seen when four primary elements converge:
  - What you love (your passion)
  - What the world needs (your mission)
  - What you are good at (your vocation)
  - What you can get paid for (your profession)

When you discover your own ikigai, it will bring you fulfilment, happiness and make you live longer.
