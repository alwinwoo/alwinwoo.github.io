> "The core of the engineering mind-set is what I call modular systems thinking. It’s not a singular talent, but a melange of techniques and principles. Systems-level thinking is more than just being systematic; rather, it’s about the understanding that in the ebb and flow of life, nothing is stationary and everything is linked. The relationships among the modules of a system give rise to a whole that cannot be understood by analyzing its constituent parts."<br>- Guru Madhavan

I enjoyed engineering when I was in university, even though the subjects were dry and often too technical for my liking.

However, the concepts that I developed during this period have helped me to become who I am today.

Engineers use a unique mode of thinking based on seeing everything as a system - adopting an engineering mindset using the 3 different properties can help you in any field.

# Three Essential Properties of the Engineering Mind-Set

1. **The ability to see a structure where there’s nothing apparent**. Consider how the elements of the system are linked in logic, in time, in sequence, and in function—and under what conditions they work and don’t work. Having a systematic systems-level thinking of structure helps people to ask the right questions in a logical way.
2. **Adeptness at designing under constraints**. The real world is full of constraints that make or break potential. Whether natural or human-made, engineers don't wait until all phenomena or constraints are fully understood and explained before working on the problem.
3. **Understanding Trade-offs**. Develop the ability to hold alternative ideas in your head and make considered judgments. Identify and make design priorities, allocate resources by separating weak goals from stronger or more important ones. 

I am glad I had been trained in engineering.
