# Story-telling Techniques / Also for Public Speaking

![Falling](http://cloud-files-cdn.sparkol.com/website-spk/inmediasres.png)

A good public speaker takes their audience on a journey, leaving them feeling inspired and motivated. But structuring your speech to get your ideas across and keep your audience engaged all the way through is tricky.

1. **Tell using the Hero's Journey (Monomyth)**
The monomyth (also called the hero's journey), is a story structure that is found in many folk tales, myths and religious writings from around the world. In a monomyth, the hero is called to leave their home and sets out on a difficult journey. They move from somewhere they know into a threatening unknown place. Using the monomyth to shape your presentation can help you to explain what has brought you to the wisdom you want to share. It can bring your message alive for your audience.

2. **Map the Mountain**
The mountain structure is a way of mapping the tension and drama in a story. It's similar to the monomyth because it helps us to plot when certain events occur in a story. It's different because it doesn't necessarily have a happy ending. The first part of the story is given to setting the scene, and is followed by just a series of small challenges and rising action before a climactic conclusion. It's a bit like a TV series – each episode has its ups and downs, all building up to a big finale at the end of the season.

3. **Start at the Middle**
In medias res storytelling is when you begin your narrative in the heat of the action, before starting over at the beginning to explain how you got there. By dropping your audience right into the most exciting part of your story they'll be gripped from the beginning and will stay engaged to find out what happens. But be careful – you don't want to give away too much of the action straight away. Try hinting at something bizarre or unexpected – something that needs more explanation. Give your audience just enough information to keep them hooked, as you go back and set the scene of your story.

4. **Have an Enemy and a Hero**
Stories need a good guy and a bad guy – also called a hero and an enemy. The enemy can be a thing, like a desert or “the system” or even a fear within the hero. The arc of the story is how the hero beats the enemy. Questions to ask yourself about this might include: What’s the core enemy of my customers or clients? Is it danger? Wasted money? Unfulfilled dreams? Bad hair?

5. **Use Conflict**
Conflict is how the friction between the enemy and hero manifests. Maybe it shows up as the hero deciding to cross the desert, or when you, the business owner, decided to figure out how to defeat a problem. Conflict also describes the obstacles you encountered on your way to success, whether they were problems with your bank or with a tornado. If the hero has no struggle, then it’s a lame story.

6. **Omit any Irrelevant Detail**
Omit any detail that doesn’t move the story forward or develop the characters. This is about keeping the readers’ attention. If they don’t need to know about your red bicycle to understand the arc of your story, don’t tell them about the bicycle. If they don’t need to know what kind of awesome, high-tech sneakers you used to cross the desert, don’t tell them about the sneakers.

7. **Tell the Story Like You Talk**
This one’s pretty simple. Corporate-speak ruins stories. Talk like you would normally talk. If you sound a little too corporate to pass as an average person, hire a storyteller.

8. **Make It Visual**
There’s a reason children’s storybooks are mostly pictures, and that so many of the greatest stories ever told have been made into movies. Images bring a story to life. You can tell a story just by standing up and talking, but it had better be one heart-clutcher of a story. And even then, added images will make it more powerful.

9. **Make It Personal & Easy to Relate To**
To immediately borrow from the last point: Use images of what actually happened, or where it happened. Use images of the real people in the story, not stock photo models. And again, talk like you talk. Show your personality. Reveal a bit of your weaknesses and your fears. Everybody else has those weaknesses and fears, too. This leverages a subtle power of storytelling: When we tell our own story, often we are telling other people’s story too. Those people are your ideal audience, and your ideal customers or clients.

10. **Add Surprise**
A story with no surprises is boring. You knew this already (because you’re already a storyteller, remember?), but it bears repeating. Whether it’s a good surprise or a bad surprise, every good story has at least one surprise. This is an essential to a story as conflict.
