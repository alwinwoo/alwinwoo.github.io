# Dragon

As the dragon flew overhead, Jack ducked instinctively.

+++++

"On its own, it would have been an easy kill. But that's not how it works, Johnny. We have to work together."

At this point, the salamander started closing in on the bat, and he let his gun go, hurling himself back a few feet. The bat was drawn into the walls of a wall, but it still had the full force of the exploding firearm swinging at it. In one deft movement, Jack had the bats wing beaten apart, causing it to fall over in a cloud of dust. But now the salamander could no longer watch over its ally. It was too powerful, and Jack was afraid that it could escape, but before

+++++

He thought maybe, he could use the exhaust fan to make the cut but he hadn't the time or even thought of it. It was too dangerous to try. He could feel how close he was to the dragon's breath. It was close enough to me he thought, but I can't feel him anymore, he did not want the dragon to hear his thoughts.

"Jack, stay away," Rachael called out. "It will get us killed."

Jack turned and saw her in her orange skirts with her narrow shoulders and long curly hair waving back and forth. Her cheeks were flushed. "Not my fault, Mom," he thought.

+++++

A fire bolt streaked over his shoulder, where he was still leaning over. Jack had moved, which meant that no one was chasing him.

"Which way?" he called out.

The dragon began to turn slowly, as if seeking direction, even as the bullets followed it.

"Uh…make way, please."

Something bigger and black appeared behind it. Before the dragon could recover, Jack had already raced out of the meadow.

The giant dragon had faded into the distance, flying across a plain before ending up in a field behind a small farm house. Jack glanced back in time to see it get up and swoop

+++++

They lay low, as if attempting to avoid the almost certain killing of their two-man team. And yet, they could not get close. Herrean didn't care. He was looking for something else. He'd observed something from his vantage point, something else that could signal the enemy. All Jack could do was hope, hoping that after the previous three days she'd become more experienced than this kid. So that she wouldn't be overwhelmed by fear, and could find a way to find out what that thing was.

"Is he keeping watch over us?"

Jack kicked out, her leg reaching up in front of her to block a sword strike.

+++++

An emotional yearning surged up within him, as he pushed past the overwhelming desire to fly, to be high in the air. He felt strong, powerful, and untouchable, all at once. His legs held, and the dragon hurtled to a stop.

Jack waited for the dragon to land again, but instead of making a sound, it only smiled at him, turned, and flew away again. Jack froze in horror at his instinctive response, terrified that he was now falling faster, never faster than he'd jumped. To be alive was incredible; to be dead was...perhaps not so wonderful.

Jack turned and stared at the Nevermore again, as if hoping

+++++

"Looks like the dragon really likes you."

Jack was momentarily frozen in place. He had never felt the urge to hurt or humiliate someone before, but now the dragon spoke to him in his own language. This made him very uneasy. His mouth was dry, his breath was becoming increasingly labored, and his legs felt like jelly. He looked at the dragon, trying to decide what to say to him. He knew that there was nothing he could say that would get him out of this predicament, but he couldn't stop thinking of what would happen if Jack were to react in any way.

Jack took a moment to think. Finally, he nodded slowly, his fingers curling

+++++

"Hold on! Sarge, dodge!"

Without any warning, the Dragon fired at them, disorienting them. Jack saw the dragon swoop down and fire a large red energy beam at him. Although it hit him in the chest, Jack used his grappling hook to break it out of the air and flipped off the Dragon. He landed on the ground and then checked his weapon for a second before taking out his gun.

"Where is he?"

"Tampa Bay, that's what I was told. As soon as it finished the second phase of its egg laying, he started his third phase, the evolution phase. He'll be attacking our coastlines, so he

# Airship

As the flaming airship plunged over him, Jack ducked instinctively.

+++++

"Tah dah!" said one, "I'm ready!" he announced cheerfully.

Jack fired his pistol without taking aim. The slug pinged off the huge metal ball on the ship's underside. He released a muffled groan and dropped from his perch.

Dishwashers sluiced forward and water splashed off the massive hull. He glanced around and saw his nemesis circling in for the kill.

"Lo! Hardy Trimmer! Heh-heh-heh!" said the Pilot.

Jack's eyes narrowed and he fired his own pistol in a complete cycle. The gun's wad was

+++++

The statue's torch beam brought his face close to its glowing visage.

"Fascinating, isn't it," he breathed. "You two look just like you did when I last saw you, within a few hours."

A nod, and Jack spun the torch, casting a shadow over the little figure. It was wearing some sort of matching cloak, the material clinging to its form like something that had dried and hardened. It had on a black vest and black trousers, and one small silver ring was affixed to its ear.

There was another flash of light, and then the statue toppled, leaving Jack in his place. The black thing it

+++++

Gazing up, he saw it soon disappear in a thick cloud of smoke.

Jack stood, groaning, swaying with the cold. He winced inwardly. He could not help but wonder if G-Man would ever come back to him, and what form would that be. It was his dream, after all, after all it had done. He wanted the Daedalus to reach him. He wanted it to land him back on their world. But it was now past midnight, there was nothing left in the passage to explain it. It was all over. Nothing could be gained from the old Black Tower now, Jack.

He raised his head

+++++

The instrument had started to fail, already.

His own HUD was starting to crackle, and from the phone-contacts stacked on his office desk he had missed the smokeballs from the rapid-fire blasts. His eyes were going blind.

He felt as if he were being stabbed in the chest.

Someone — or something — was coming.

He slammed his fist against his personal terminal, and the light came on.

His eyes snapped open.

The voice over the loudspeaker was nearly too loud for him to listen to. "Welcome back, flight," it said. "As always,
