# Plot
Jack, a Yungol farmboy 
* finds a dragon egg, 
* protects by hiding it in the mountains, 
* hatches and feeds it,
* learns how to fly it and 
* joins the Yeelands Dragoon Force.

# Objectives
1. Introduce a dragon type in Leyond
- they are like horses, different types, cannot talk, can be trained, can fight (4 limbs, 2 claws, tail spikes/clubs), breathe fire (some)
- buoyancy, strength, endurance => there are limits to how much they can carry, affecting how far and high they can fly
- use -> unarmored scouts to armoured steeds; mounted or unmounted (free fliers) 
- for future stories - use magic? sentient?
- give glimpse and compare with Changyi's aerial vessels

# Characters
Jack
Johnny

9. "Combat" and Recruitment

As the dragons flew overhead, Jack ducked instinctively.

"On its own, it would have been an easy kill. But that's not how it works, Johnny. We have to work together."

It was too dangerous to try. He could feel how close he was to the dragon's breath. 

It was close enough to me he thought, but I can't feel him anymore, he did not want the dragon to hear his thoughts.

"Jack, stay away," Johnny called out. "It will get us killed."

At this point, the salamander started closing in on the bat, and he let his gun go, hurling himself back a few feet. 

The bat was drawn into the walls of a wall, but it still had the full force of the exploding firearm swinging at it. 

In one deft movement, Jack had the bats wing beaten apart, causing it to fall over in a cloud of dust. 

But now the salamander could no longer watch over its ally. 

It was too powerful, and Jack was afraid that it could escape, but before

A fire bolt streaked over his shoulder, where he was still leaning over. Jack had moved, which meant that no one was chasing him.

"Which way?" he called out.



The dragon began to turn slowly, as if seeking direction, even as the bullets followed it.

"Uh... make way, please."

"Is he keeping watch over us?"

Something bigger and black appeared behind it. Before the dragon could recover, Jack had already raced out of the meadow.

The giant dragon had faded into the distance, flying across a plain before ending up in a field behind a small farm house. Jack glanced back in time to see it get up and swoop

"Looks like the dragon really likes you."

Jack takes flight

An emotional yearning surged up within him, as he pushed past the overwhelming desire to fly, to be high in the air. He felt strong, powerful, and untouchable, all at once. His legs held, and the dragon hurtled to a stop.

Jack waited for the dragon to land again, but instead of making a sound, it only smiled at him, turned, and flew away again. Jack froze in horror at his instinctive response, terrified that he was now falling faster, never faster than he'd jumped. To be alive was incredible; to be dead was...perhaps not so wonderful.


Jack was momentarily frozen in place. He had never felt the urge to hurt or humiliate someone before, but now the dragon spoke to him in his own language. This made him very uneasy. His mouth was dry, his breath was becoming increasingly labored, and his legs felt like jelly. He looked at the dragon, trying to decide what to say to him. He knew that there was nothing he could say that would get him out of this predicament, but he couldn't stop thinking of what would happen if Jack were to react in any way.

Jack took a moment to think. Finally, he nodded slowly, his fingers curling

"Hold on! Sarge, dodge!"

Without any warning, the Dragon fired at them, disorienting them. Jack saw the dragon swoop down and fire a large red energy beam at him. Although it hit him in the chest, Jack used his grappling hook to break it out of the air and flipped off the Dragon. He landed on the ground and then checked his weapon for a second before taking out his gun.

"Where is he?"

"Tampa Bay, that's what I was told. As soon as it finished the second phase of its egg laying, he started his third phase, the evolution phase. He'll be attacking our coastlines, so he
