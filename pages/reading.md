The habit of reading is one of the best qualities that a person can possess. If reading is a habit you’d like to get into, there are a number of ways to cultivate it.

Here are some tips that I use to maintain a lifetime of reading habit:

# Motivating Yourself
1. **Choose a book that you like**. Realize that reading is highly enjoyable, if you have a good book that you want to read. Read fun and compelling books. Find books that really grip you and make you want to read — and that’s the goal here. After you have cultivated the reading habit, you can move on to more difficult stuff, but for now, go for the fun, gripping stuff. 
2. **Make it pleasurable**. Make your reading time your favorite time of day. Have good tea or coffee while you read, or another kind of treat. Sit in a comfortable chair. Read during sunrise or sunset, or at the beach. Make it something that you enjoy.
3. **Find the right reading environment**. Find a quiet place where you can sit down comfortably. There should be no television or computer near the chair to minimize distractions, and no music or noisy family members/roommates. If you don’t have a place like this, create one. The neighbourhood library could be a suitable alternative. 

# Tapping on Serendipity
4. **Always carry a book**. Wherever you go, always take a book with you. I always have a book (either physical or e-copy) with me that has been borrowed from the library. If there is a time when I have to wait, I will whip out my book and read. Great way to pass time.
5. **Go to book fairs or used bookshops**. My favorite place to go is a discount (or secondhand) book store. When Times Bookstore or Popular have clearance sales, I will stock up on books. During this time, you can get a lot of books for cheap. It is also very fun to browse through different sections that you don't normally go or get a few books that people have donated or sold. 
9. **Have a library day**. Even cheaper than a used book shop is a library, of course. Make it a weekly trip.

# "Advanced" Tips

## Set Goals
6. **Set a high goal**. Tell yourself that you want to read 50 books this year (or some other number like that). Then try to accomplish it. Just be sure you’re still enjoying the reading though — don’t make it a rushed chore.

## Block Your Time
7. **Set aside time to read** You should have a few set times during the day when you’ll read for at least 5 to 10 minutes. These are times that you will read no matter what — triggers that happen each day. For example, make it a habit to read during breakfast and lunch (and even dinner if you eat alone). 
10. **Reduce television/Internet**. If you really want to read more, try cutting back on TV or Internet consumption. This may be difficult for many people. Still, every minute you reduce of Internet/TV, you could use for reading. This could create hours of book reading time.
8. **Have a reading hour or reading day**. If you turn off the TV or Internet in the evening, you could have a set hour (perhaps just after dinner) when you and your family can read each night. Make it a day if you can.

## Writing It Down
11. **Make a list**. Keep a list of all the great books you want to read. You can keep this in your journal, in a pocket notebook, on your personal home page, on your personal wiki, wherever. Be sure to add to it whenever you hear about a good book, online or in person. Keep a running list, and cross out the ones you read. 

> Create an email (Gmail/Yahoo/whatever) account for your book list, and email the address every time you hear about a good book. 
> Use your inbox will be your reading list. When you’ve read a book, file it under “Done”. 

12. **Keep a log**. Similar to the reading list, this log should have not only the title and author of the books you read, but the dates you start and finish them if possible. Even better, put a note next to each with your thoughts about the book. It is extremely satisfying to go back over the log after a couple of months to see all the great books you’ve read.

> Using the same email address, reply to the message with notes about the book, and those will be in the same conversation thread, so now your email account is your reading log too.

13. **Blog it**. One of the best ways to form a habit is to put it on your blog. If you don’t have one, create one. Ask your family or friends to give you book suggestions and comment on the ones you’re reading. It keeps you accountable for your goals.

> You can use github too, like me :)

## Become a Reading Champion
14. **Read to your child**. If you have children, read to them. Creating the reading habit in your kids is the best way to ensure they’ll be readers when they grow up. Find some great children’s books and read to them. You’re developing the reading habit in yourself and spending quality time with your child at the same time.
