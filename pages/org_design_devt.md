With close to 60% of organizational restructuring and redesigns failing, the world today has shown us that there is a pressing need to review our organizational structures and designs. 

Building capabilities in this domain is absolutely critical for today and especially for our new future.

- What is Org Design, Org Development and what's the difference?
- What's the difference between traditional OD and Dialogic OD?

  - Traditional OD typically has a diagnostic phase followed by an intervention
  - Dialogic OD is primarily aimed for “emergent change”
    - change is fluid and not planned out in a regimented project management style approach
    - it is the opposite of an implementation with strong and ongoing change leadership 
    - needs a leader who supports the change and then gets out of the way
  - important factors for Dialogic OD
    - is to be crystal clear on what issue is being addressed by the organization
    - primary stakeholders must also be clearly defined for this approach to be successful
    - willing to try a lot of things and see what work - pilot projects are the norm to find out what might work to help improve the issue at hand
      - experiments are key to tackling adaptive challenges
      - do not look for the one big “right” answer to an organizational issue
      - instead, take any of the “probably good” answers to a problem and advance it
      - gain traction with that one answer instead of waiting a long time for the perfect solution
