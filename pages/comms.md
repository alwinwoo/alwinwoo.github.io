## Scrum in less than 10 minutes

  - Product Backlog (list / wishlist of features called User-Stories)
  - Release Backlog (breakdown of product backlog into different releases)
    - prioritise user-stories and estimate amount of work involved
    - estimate in hours (1/2/4/8h for 1 day, 2/3/5/10 days, 1/2/3/6 mths - need to breakdown)
    - total amount of time = completion time
  - Sprint Backlog  (breakdown of release backlog into short sprints)
    - to have features for testing
  - Burndown Charts (monitor amount of work left in the sprint backlog)
  - Scrum meetings  (ensuring everything is on track)
  - retrospective meeting (fine-tune)

## Scrum Tips
1. Be Clear on Desired Outcomes
    - clarity on purpose of project and what is to be achieved
2. Prioritise Ruthlessly
    - maximise work not done
3. Just Enough Planning
    - have only high-level plans at launch
    - achieve clarity at weekly meetings on exact tashs and man-hours required
4. Do One Thing at a Time
    - do most high-value and urgent work first
    - complete meaningful tasks each week rather than have lots of "ongoing" unfinished work
5. Self-Organising Teams
    - let team members determine what needs to be done, and who to do what
6. Sustaining Momentum
    - organise work into fixed units of time
    - eg. sprint between 1 to 4 weeks
7. Protype and Iterate
    - deliver something concrete each week
    - get feedback early and then iterate
    - establish a regular tempo and be agile to repond to changing needs and circumstances
8. Huddles, Not Meetings
    - prefer informal huddles held to a fixed duration of time
    - typically 15 minutes long, done in an informal setup
9. Reflect and Adapt
    - work mindfully with regular self-reflection
    - what has gone well, not gone well, how to improve
    - emphasis good relationships and continuous process improvement
