## What is ikigai? 

Ikigai (pronounced “eye-ka-guy”) is, above all else, a lifestyle that strives to balance the spiritual with the practical. This balance is found at the intersection where your passions and talents converge with the things that the world needs and is willing to pay for. Hector Garcia, the co-author of Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life writes this:
> Your ikigai is at the intersection of what you are good at and what you love doing.

In Japan, people who have discovered their ikigai (pronounced ick-ee-guy) jump out of bed every morning, knowing exactly what they need to do. 

What about you? What is your reason for getting up in the morning? 

## Why is knowing your ikigai important? 

One of the many mistakes people made in life is believing that money leads to fulfillment. If money is your ikigai, then good for you!

However for others, the pursuit of money may not be so:

> Just as humans have lusted after objects and money since the dawn of time, other humans have felt dissatisfaction at the relentless pursuit of money and fame and have instead focused on something bigger than their own material wealth. This has over the years been described using many different words and practices, but always hearkening back to the central core of meaningfulness in life.

Studies have shown that not having an ikigai can have a detrimental effect on your life.

## How can I discover my ikigai? 

Follow your curiosity. Find out the kind of activities that make your heart beat and the kind of activities that you dislike. Don’t ask what the world needs, ask what makes you come alive, and do it. What the world needs is people who have come alive. When you find it, pursue it with all you have because anything less is not worth your limited time on Earth.

As you look for your ikigai, keep asking yourself these four questions:
  1. What do I love?
  2. What am I good at?
  3. What can I be paid for now — or is there something that will transform into my future hustle?
  4. What does the world need?

## How will I know if I've discovered it? 

Ikigai is about finding joy, fulfillment, and balance in the daily routine of life.

You will realise your ikigai when these four primary elements converge:
  - What you love (your passion)
  - What the world needs (your mission)
  - What you are good at (your vocation)
  - What you can get paid for (your profession)

When this happens, you will find that pursuing your ikigai will bring you fulfilment, happiness and make you want to live longer.
