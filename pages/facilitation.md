# Common Questions
  -	What are some ways to facilitate effectively on virtual platforms? 
  - What are some key things you should look out for? 
  -	How do you keep participants engaged online? 

# Facilitation in a Virtual Environment

IAF Virtual Facilitation Techniques - 02/04/20
* To understand what we gain and what we lose through a virtual platform, get over the hurdle that this is not about technology, it is about the people

* Benefits
  * Convenient for many and removes the travel time 
  * The power of anonymity and allows a much lower stake conversation. Allow participants contribute on another neutral format
  * Activist - They can drive meetings and interact with facial queues / Reflector - They can package their ideas and thoughts and engage fully from their comfort zone

* Best Practices
  * Frame the intention of the event and set the expectations - this will be a collaborative workshop - Divergent (brainstorm ideas, perspectives, possible solutions etc.) or Convergent (synthesising ideas, prioritising solutions or outcomes, making decisions developing next steps.  
  * Set etiquette rules - we expect you to turn your camera on, find a quiet space, block up your time to not be disturbed
  * Build more space and time to process emotions and conversations, acknowledge things that emerge and park in time after the session to process that

* Engagement
  * Visuals on screen promotes more interactive engagement with participants 
  * Find points of connection with each other, what links us to each other, check out of work for a bit
  * Play around with the physical space, have people engage with physical objects in their own space

* Roles
  * Co-facilitate - One person looking after the people, one person to look after the technology
  * Scribe to manage the chat and conversations and to manage the time

* Opening 
  * Check-in - What is going on for you, what is going on for you with friends and family & how are you?
  * Set the context of the meeting, and build the container and expectations

* Deep conversations
  * Match the energy of the group, do a poll to check the energy of the room to get a sensing
  * To check in with gaining permission from participants on certain work that they want to handle

# Facilitation in an Agile Setting

The Facilitation Agenda Flow:

  1a.  “Tribes” exercise was the start and it was used to build rapport.  
  1b.  Another opener for building rapport is any type of picture cards, where everyone chooses a picture and explains why they chose this. A fun story from this exercise is that someone on the team had “run with the bulls” in Barcelona! You should have seen how impressed the rest of the team was. That sort of fun doesn’t normally come out in day to day conversation.  
  2.  “Constellations” exercise was next allowing silent expression of opinion (Links to resources from Lyssa Adkins that explain constellations are in the appendix).  
  3. “Silent Brainstorming” in small groups in the retrospective portion to build on the trust that was gained in the Constellation exercise.  
  4. “Rotating Flip charts” allowed the whole group to see what other groups had put on their small group retrospective boards.  
  5.  Small Group Prioritization/Voting allowed each group to express their top desire for change in the next release.  
  6.  Large group prioritization via a grid outlining “Impact to the Team” (Low to High) and “Ability to Fix” (Low to High). We gathered back together as a large room and had each team place their #1 recommendation on the grid as a visual radiator.  
  7.  “ROTI” (Return on Time Invested) was used to express if the team thought the1.5 hours spent in the program level retrospective was worth it. The scale was 0 (No value) to 4 (high value). The majority of the feedback was in 3 or 4, and all of the sticky notes in the 2 category were because they wanted MORE time!
