# Facilitation in a Virtual Environment

IAF Virtual Facilitation Techniques - 02/04/20
* To understand what we gain and what we lose through a virtual platform, get over the hurdle that this is not about technology, it is about the people

* Benefits
  * Convenient for many and removes the travel time 
  * The power of anonymity and allows a much lower stake conversation. Allow participants contribute on another neutral format
  * Activist - They can drive meetings and interact with facial queues / Reflector - They can package their ideas and thoughts and engage fully from their comfort zone

* Best Practices
  * Frame the intention of the event and set the expectations - this will be a collaborative workshop - Divergent (brainstorm ideas, perspectives, possible solutions etc.) or Convergent (synthesising ideas, prioritising solutions or outcomes, making decisions developing next steps.  
  * Set etiquette rules - we expect you to turn your camera on, find a quiet space, block up your time to not be disturbed
  * Build more space and time to process emotions and conversations, acknowledge things that emerge and park in time after the session to process that

* Engagement
  * Visuals on screen promotes more interactive engagement with participants 
  * Find points of connection with each other, what links us to each other, check out of work for a bit
  * Play around with the physical space, have people engage with physical objects in their own space

* Roles
  * Co-facilitate - One person looking after the people, one person to look after the technology
  * Scribe to manage the chat and conversations and to manage the time

* Opening 
  * Check-in - What is going on for you, what is going on for you with friends and family & how are you?
  * Set the context of the meeting, and build the container and expectations

* Deep conversations
  * Match the energy of the group, do a poll to check the energy of the room to get a sensing
  * To check in with gaining permission from participants on certain work that they want to handle
