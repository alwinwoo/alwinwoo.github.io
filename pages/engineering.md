> Engineers use a unique mode of thinking based on seeing everything as a system. They see structures that aren’t apparent to the layperson, they know how to design under constraints, and they understand trade-offs. Adopting an engineering mindset can help you in any field.

I enjoyed engineering when I was in university.

The subjects were dry and often too technical for my liking.

However, the concepts that I developed during this period have helped me to become who I am today.

> The core of the engineering mind-set is what I call modular systems thinking. It’s not a singular talent, but a melange of techniques and principles.
> Systems-level thinking is more than just being systematic; rather, it’s about the understanding that in the ebb and flow of life, nothing is stationary and everything is linked. 
> The relationships among the modules of a system give rise to a whole that cannot be understood by analyzing its constituent parts.

# Three Essential Properties of the Engineering Mind-Set

1. The ability to see a structure where there’s nothing apparent.
2. Adeptness at designing under constraints
3. Understanding Trade-offs
