Despite having mapped out my [ikigai](https://alwinwoo.github.io/pages/ikigai.html), I have realised that as you pursue your interests and passion, you always learn and evolve through the years. 

As such, there will always be areas that you want to develop, to become better in.

## What I Want to Learn

To build up my profession and vocation areas, these are the areas that I need to work on:

1. Public Speaking
2. Facilitation
3. Asking Probing Questions
4. Gaining Greater Self-Awareness

## Former Ikigai Areas

However, given one's limited time on earth to gain skills or knowledge, we need to bear the following in mind:

1. Comparing yourself to others is a recipe for unhappiness.
2. You can be anything but you can’t be everything.
3. There is one thing that you’re better at than other people: being you.
4. If you want to compare, compare yourself against who you were yesterday.

As such given the lack of time, these are the areas that I have decided to stop actively pursuing:

1. Music
2. [Photography][]

## Areas Explored that are NOT my Ikigai

In my opinion, that's true for people too. 

Sometimes you have to experiment a little to figure out which paths not to take, but knowing when to stop is an important quality to have.

Having tried some of the activities below, I have found that they neither give me joy nor reveal any hidden talent in me:

1. Artwork - Drawing / Illustration / Sketching / Pottery etc.
2. Dancing
3. Singing
4. Sports
