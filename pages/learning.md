# My Areas of Development

1. Public Speaking
2. Facilitation
3. Asking Probing Questions
4. Gaining Greater Self-Awareness

However, given one's limited time on earth to gain skills or knowledge, we need bear the following in mind:

1. Comparing yourself to others is a recipe for unhappiness.
2. You can be anything but you can’t be everything.
3. There is one thing that you’re better at than other people: being you.
4. If you want to compare, compare yourself against who you were yesterday.
