Here's a glimpse of the various areas of programming that one can explore or dabble in:

# Software on Hardware
* firmware/code that makes the hardware work
* one of the languages I used to learn was Assembly - it was tough

# Arduino
  * need to download arduino IDE
  * Digispark ATtiny85
    * open Arduino ide and then go to preferences and then in additional board magae url paste this given url for Digispark :-
    * http://digistump.com/package_digistump_index.json
    * Now go to boards manager and download the Digispark boards

# [Software on Server - Linux](https://alwinwoo.github.io/pages/web_admin.html)
* code telling the computer what to do eg. set up a web server (on PCs/laptops/embedded devices/single-board computers eg. raspberry pi)
* install necessary code for hosting web services, anti-virus, databases etc.
* securing the server against unauthorised access

# [Running a Website - HTML and CSS](https://alwinwoo.github.io/pages/web_css.html)
* setting up a website
* displaying content in a visually appealing way

# [Programming for Interactivity - PHP and Javascript](https://alwinwoo.github.io/pages/java.html)
* coding for interactive websites
* server vs client processing

# [Programming for Apple - Swift](https://alwinwoo.github.io/pages/swift.html)
* Applications on Apple Store

# Programming for Android
* Applications on Google Play

# Python
* data analysis
* 

There are other older languages that I had learnt in the past but have faded into memory. These were:

* Assembly
* Basic
* Fortran
* QBasic
* Turbo Pascal
* Visual Basic
* Visual C
